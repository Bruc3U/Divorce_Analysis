# ðŸ’’ Divorce Analysis Project

# Objective

This project's goal is to determine the main reasons for divorce according to the given dataset. 

# Python Libraries Used

- pandas
- matplotlib
- numpy
- scikit-learn

# About the dataset

The dataset is a collection of 170 couples and their answers. Those couples were asked the same 53 questions and were given a 5-point scale to answer them.

- 0=never
- 1=seldom
- 2=Averagely
- 3=frequently
- 4=always

The data was extracted via the UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository and can be found [here](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/497/divorce+predictors+data+set).

It is important to note any limitations given by the data itself. In order to find a viable and realistic solution to the problem we must analyze the context.

| Dataset Limitation | 
|---|
| No real information on the couples day to day life, limited context|
| The panel is from a different country (Turkey) |
| The questions had to be translated | 
| The nature of the experiment can bring bias since all of those couples were already in therapy |

The panel being from a different country could affect the reason for divorce since the cultural expectation is different. In addition to that, no other context was given for those couples, we do not know their age, their psychological background, their family situation...<br>
Another limitation is that all of the presented couples are already in therapy, the drawn conclusion could not apply to the average Western European couple that just met for instance. 


# I/Defining the goal:

Marriage represents a huge chunk of our Western civilization. Marriage can be defined as the legally and formally recognized union of two people as partners in a personal relationship. 
Despite a long history, nowadays nearly 50% of those sacred unions end up in a divorce. 

Why do people get divorced so much?

| The 5 most common reasons for divorce | 
|---|
| 1. Lack of Commitment|
| 2. Infidelity |
| 3. Too much conflict | 
| 4. Getting married too young |
| 5. Financial issues |

Our goal will be to shed some light on the matter and figure out the main reasons to divorce thanks to machine learning.
